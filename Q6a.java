/*
    You are given a class NumberPrinter with three methods: printZero, printEven, and printOdd.
    These methods are designed to print the numbers 0, even numbers, and odd numbers, respectively.
    Task:
    Create a ThreadController class that coordinates three threads:
    5. ZeroThread: Calls printZero to print 0s.
    6. EvenThread: Calls printEven to print even numbers.
    7. OddThread: Calls printOdd to print odd numbers.
    These threads should work together to print the sequence "0102030405..." up to a specified number n.
The output should be interleaved, ensuring that the numbers are printed in the correct order.
 */

/*
    Approach
    Use Three Threads: One for printing 0, one for even numbers, and one for odd numbers.
    Synchronization: Use a shared lock to control execution order.
    Wait-Notify Mechanism:
    printZero() waits for its turn (when count % 2 == 0).
    printOdd() waits for count % 4 == 1.
    printEven() waits for count % 4 == 3.
    After printing, each thread increments count and notifies all waiting threads.
    Ensuring Proper Order: Threads execute alternately, ensuring the output format 0 X 0 Y 0 Z ....
    Time Complexity:
    O(n) â€“ Each number (zero, odd, even) is printed exactly once in sequence.

    Space Complexity:
    O(1) â€“ Only a few variables and synchronization objects are used, independent of n. ðŸš€
